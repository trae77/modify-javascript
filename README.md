modify javascript to create a working password generator .

Motivation
I wanted to verify my ability to write a functioning generator into existence using JavaScript.

Why?
Most people don't like thinking of passwords, they don't like trying to make the passwords strong, and lots of jobs require passwords to change monthly. This Generater will combine anywhere from 8 to 128 characters including the choices of lower case, upper case, special characters, and numbers. This solves all the previously mentioned headaches and saves the user time.

What I learned and how will what I learned solve problems
how to create and call upon functions
how to properly store and access variables when I need them.
how to interact with the console in a way that allows me to check my scripts function one step at a time during the building process.
how to use event listeners
These lessons contain the building blocks of JavaScript with enough higher function to be used as refrence in my future endeavours, whether it be debugging code or creating my own.
